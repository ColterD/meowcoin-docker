# Meowcoin Docker - Issues Fixed and Improvements Made

This document summarizes all the issues identified and fixed in the meowcoin-docker repository.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Volume Mount Conflict (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** The docker-compose.yml had conflicting volume mounts:
- `meowcoin_logs:/tmp` (volume mount)
- `tmpfs: - /tmp` (tmpfs mount)

**Impact:** Logs were not persisting and were inaccessible from the host.

**Fix:** 
- Changed log volume mount from `/tmp` to `/var/log/meowcoin`
- Updated both core and monitor services
- Updated Dockerfiles to create the log directory with proper permissions

### 2. Service Dependency Race Condition
**Issue:** Monitor service started when core service was "started" but not necessarily "healthy".

**Impact:** Monitor could fail to connect to core service during startup.

**Fix:** Changed dependency condition from `service_started` to `service_healthy`.

### 3. Missing Binary Validation
**Issue:** No validation that meowcoin binaries were properly downloaded and executable.

**Impact:** Container could start but fail silently if binaries were corrupted.

**Fix:** Added `validate_binaries()` function to check binary existence and executability.

## Security Improvements

### 4. RPC Binding Security
**Issue:** RPC server was bound to all interfaces (`bind=0.0.0.0`) without proper restrictions.

**Impact:** Potential security risk if container network was compromised.

**Fix:** 
- Added explicit `rpcbind` directives for localhost and Docker networks
- Maintained P2P binding to all interfaces for network connectivity
- Updated both template and hardcoded configuration

### 5. Enhanced Signal Handling
**Issue:** No graceful shutdown handling for the meowcoin daemon.

**Impact:** Potential data corruption during container shutdown.

**Fix:** Added signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT with graceful shutdown logic.

## Reliability Improvements

### 6. Download Script Robustness
**Issue:** Hardcoded commit hash in download URLs could fail for different versions.

**Impact:** Build failures when using specific versions.

**Fix:** 
- Added fallback URL patterns without commit hash
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Better validation of download URLs

### 7. Log Management
**Issue:** Logs were written to tmpfs, making debugging difficult.

**Impact:** Loss of diagnostic information and poor troubleshooting experience.

**Fix:**
- Moved logs to persistent volume mount
- Added fallback logging to /tmp if volume mount fails
- Updated all logging functions in both services

### 8. Error Handling and Validation
**Issue:** Missing validation and error handling in multiple places.

**Impact:** Silent failures and difficult debugging.

**Fix:**
- Added comprehensive error handling in entrypoint scripts
- Improved logging with timestamps and structured messages
- Added validation for critical operations

## User Experience Improvements

### 9. Configuration Management
**Issue:** No easy way to manage environment variables and configuration.

**Impact:** Difficult customization and deployment.

**Fix:**
- Created `.env.example` file with all configurable options
- Added documentation for environment configuration
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 10. Documentation and Troubleshooting
**Issue:** Limited troubleshooting guidance and documentation.

**Impact:** Users struggled with common issues.

**Fix:**
- Created comprehensive `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` guide
- Updated README with new features and log access instructions
- Added quick status check script improvements

### 11. Status Monitoring
**Issue:** Status script had outdated paths and limited functionality.

**Impact:** Difficult to diagnose issues quickly.

**Fix:**
- Updated `check-status.sh` with correct log paths
- Added status file monitoring
- Improved network connectivity checks

## Infrastructure Improvements

### 12. Directory Structure
**Issue:** Missing log directories in Docker images.

**Impact:** Permission issues and failed log writes.

**Fix:**
- Added log directory creation in Dockerfiles
- Set proper ownership and permissions
- Added volume definitions for log persistence

### 13. Container Communication
**Issue:** Inconsistent container naming could cause networking issues.

**Impact:** Service discovery problems between containers.

**Fix:**
- Maintained consistent service and container naming
- Added explicit network configuration
- Improved hostname resolution in monitor service

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Fixed volume conflicts, improved dependencies
- `meowcoin-core/Dockerfile` - Added log directory creation
- `meowcoin-core/entrypoint.sh` - Major improvements to logging, validation, and error handling
- `meowcoin-core/download-and-verify.sh` - Enhanced download robustness
- `meowcoin-monitor/Dockerfile` - Added log directory creation
- `meowcoin-monitor/entrypoint.sh` - Updated logging and status file paths

### Configuration Files
- `config/meowcoin.conf.template` - Improved security settings
- `check-status.sh` - Updated paths and added status monitoring

### New Files Created
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Testing and Validation

The build process was tested and validated:
- Docker images build successfully
- All scripts have proper permissions
- Configuration templates are valid
- Log directories are created with correct ownership

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing volumes and data are preserved
- Default configuration values remain the same
- API and CLI interfaces unchanged
- Existing docker-compose commands work as before

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Update your deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Configure environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env as needed
   ```

3. **Monitor with improved tools:**
   ```bash
   ./check-status.sh
   ```

4. **Access logs easily:**
   ```bash
   docker exec meowcoin-node cat /var/log/meowcoin/meowcoin-core.log
   ```

## Summary

These fixes address critical infrastructure issues, improve security, enhance reliability, and provide a much better user experience. The repository is now more robust, secure, and easier to troubleshoot, while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing deployments.
